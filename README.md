# Project 3 Proposal

known issues:
- firefox: setInterval time latency, sound effect may not trigger

## MVP
- 1 arrow object moving from top to bottom. 
- When the arrow falls into the acceptable range within a "hit" box, press the associated arrow key on keyboard (or click / tap on hitrange container) to evaluate. 
- Score counter to increase when hit made.

## Stretch Goal:
[x] Score counter decrease on miss
[x] More than 1 arrow at a time.
[x] Increase to 4 columns(each with their own arrow - up down left right)
[x] animation to show that an event handler took place
[x] Space button to "pause" the game
[x] Start Menu - start with interval not set.
[x] Workaround for mobile (touchstart and click register as 2 events at the moment, resulting in -2 points when clicked too early)
[x] button for pause
[x] Win / GameOver conditions..?
[x] make sure to init() / document ready
[x] Add sound for when eventlistener triggers ? hit : miss;
[x] Difficulty Levels(rate increase for speed, # of arrows appended)
[ ] Combo multiplier

## Pseudocode

### Objects involved: 
- Parent Container
- Arrow
- "hit" range container
- score counter

1. Find and select the parent container
    - then append Arrow (div with class .arrow) at top of page.
    - Arrow will be position absolute
    - Arrow will have a top value set. (aka Y-axis coordinates).

2. Make function which shifts the Arrow down:
    - decrease the Y-axis coordinate values which loop at a set interval (to be determined).

3. Make the following event handlers: 
    - "down arrow" key is pressed on the keyboard
    - mouseclick on hitrange container
    - screentap on hitrange container(mobile)

4. All 3 event handlers will:
    - verify if the y-axis of the Arrow is within the "acceptable range (to be determined)" inside the hitrange container.

5. If the arrow is within the hit range
    - make the arrow disappear & increase score counter value by 1 and update score display.
        - else -> arrow will continue to shift downwards.

6. If arrow falls off page, remove arrow.

7. repeat append Arrow "X" times (tbd);
