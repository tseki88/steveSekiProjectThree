The arrows will fall down from top to bottom, each belonging to their own column. falling Arrows will be position absolute, with top bottom starting at a fixed point. the Y axis as is scrolls will add the same value to Y top and bottom to recreate the falling motion. setInterval() On the bottom, there will be an arrowObject to 'catch' the falling arrows.
